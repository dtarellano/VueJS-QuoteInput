# vue-cli

> This is a VueJS Project given to me by an Instructor. Vue Cli components and index.html were given to me.
> The Project is an application that stores quotes generated by a user and then is displayed on Enter key. Quotes can be deleted on simply clicking an individual quote.  There is a status indicating how many quotes there are and shows the max amount of quotes to be submitted. User cannot exceed the set amount and will be alerted that they must delete a quote to in order to add more.

> This project was written on my own.
